                The Global Relief Initiative (GRI) was established in 2014 with the goal of addressing the livelihood of affected communities and households especially in the northern Nigeria, Global Relief Initiative has continuously sought ways of improving the lives of communities, household and IDPs in Nigeria with office situated in Abuja, Kogi, Adamawa and Maiduguri. Its numerous interventions have not only provided access to food security and livelihood for affected communities but also provided them awareness on their dietary intake, skill acquisition, water and good hygiene practice. To achieve this, the organization targets the community stake holder (community leader, women leader, youth leader, health facilities, religious and traditional leaders as well as institutions.)

                    GRI provides holistic interventions that meet the needs of disadvantaged groups like: internally displaced persons, returnees and people from poor rural areas affected by insurgency and natural disaster. Our specific interventions include food security and livelihood, health and nutrition, water sanitation and good hygiene practices, skills acquisition program (SAP), advocacy, community mobilization and sensitization. The organization has empowered youths in rural areas with startup kits, provide and reduce food insecurity in rural areas through cash for work intervention (CFW)

               Through a comprehensive approach, our livelihood program is built in such a way that the household is not only provided with food items or cash but also armed with food consumption, dietary knowledge and start up grant. (Over 200 households have moved from poor food consumption score to medium while 50 have move from medium to acceptable threshold, almost 70 young people have been awarded cash grant for business startup based on the required business plan in four states in Nigeria
