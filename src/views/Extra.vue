          <h4 class="mt-3 text-center">One Million Girls’ March</h4>
          <p class="font-secondary"> 
              Since 2011, October 11th every year has been designated as the International Day of the Girl. It is a day set aside by the United Nations for promoting the rights of girls and addressing the unique challenges they face. It’s a day when diverse groups come together under the same goal to highlight, discuss, and act to advance rights and opportunities for girls everywhere. The day promotes girls’ human rights, highlights gender inequalities that remain between girls and boys and addresses the various forms of discrimination and abuse suffered by girls around the world. From 2012, various themes have been developed to guide the celebration. The themes support engagement of education sector partners working  with girls to amplify their voices and stand up for their rights.
